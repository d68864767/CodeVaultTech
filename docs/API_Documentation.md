# API Documentation

This document provides a detailed description of the Application Programming Interface (API) for this project. It includes information on how to use the API, the endpoints available, and the responses you can expect to receive.

## Getting Started

To use the API, you will need to send HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints. The base URL for all requests is `http://api.website.com/v1/`.

## Authentication

Some endpoints require authentication. This is done by including an `Authorization` header with your API key in the request.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Endpoints

Below is a list of available endpoints, along with their HTTP methods, request parameters, and response formats.

### Endpoint 1

- **URL**: `/endpoint1`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **URL Parameters**: `param1=[string]`, `param2=[integer]`
- **Data Parameters**: None
- **Success Response**: 
  - **Code**: 200
  - **Content**: `{ "result": "Success" }`
- **Error Response**: 
  - **Code**: 400 BAD REQUEST
  - **Content**: `{ "error": "Invalid parameters" }`

### Endpoint 2

- **URL**: `/endpoint2`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL Parameters**: None
- **Data Parameters**: `{ "param1": "[string]", "param2": "[integer]" }`
- **Success Response**: 
  - **Code**: 201 CREATED
  - **Content**: `{ "result": "Success", "id": "[generated_id]" }`
- **Error Response**: 
  - **Code**: 400 BAD REQUEST
  - **Content**: `{ "error": "Invalid parameters" }`

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information, and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with our servers.

## Rate Limiting

To protect the API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, rate limiting is in place. If you exceed the limit, you will receive a response with a 429 status code.

## Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive guide to using the API for this project. By following the instructions and examples provided, you should be able to integrate your application with our API effectively and efficiently.
